Let's see how SNMP interface relates to `DIRECTION`:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"qmAzHvIyPkJj","outputId":"34344804-6e9c-4fab-9505-5219c04977f1"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["21267    3821\n","60097    1893\n","17475    1693\n","49473     262\n","33985      91\n","25089      87\n","6935        1\n","11373       1\n","Name: INPUT_SNMP, dtype: int64"]},"execution_count":79,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["flows[flows['DIRECTION'] == 0]['INPUT_SNMP'].value_counts()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"r1jhm4K_PkJj","outputId":"b4d57882-8881-4b2a-dc35-a4c02ea9ccf8"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["60097    957\n","49473    653\n","33985    258\n","25089    206\n","17475     44\n","21267     33\n","Name: INPUT_SNMP, dtype: int64"]},"execution_count":81,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["flows[flows['DIRECTION'] == 1]['INPUT_SNMP'].value_counts()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"t0FTLCaaPkJk","outputId":"ced29d45-2f03-4845-ad91-6e53d1f51a2d"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["60097    2787\n","21267    1976\n","49473    1364\n","33985    1030\n","17475     356\n","25089     333\n","5           3\n","Name: OUTPUT_SNMP, dtype: int64"]},"execution_count":80,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["flows[flows['DIRECTION'] == 0]['OUTPUT_SNMP'].value_counts()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"fEZ2bu1tPkJk","outputId":"d65d0e8d-de96-4fa9-fd84-a0fab694c379"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["21267    1183\n","17475     891\n","49473      43\n","60097      32\n","33985       1\n","25089       1\n","Name: OUTPUT_SNMP, dtype: int64"]},"execution_count":82,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["flows[flows['DIRECTION'] == 1]['OUTPUT_SNMP'].value_counts()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CQAMPQ0JPkJk"},"source":["As we might see, there is no clear connection between input/output SNMP interface as both interfaces are present in both 0 and 1 directions...
